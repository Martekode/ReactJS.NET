# ReactJS.NET
exploring server side rendering of react components inside asp.net. 

## Conversations with a bot. 

### Question 1:
```
can u server side render react pages in asp.net?
```
#### Answer:

Yes, it is possible to server-side render React pages in ASP.NET. There are several ways to achieve this, but one common approach is to use Node.js as a server-side rendering engine.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Create a Node.js application that can render React components on the server-side. There are several frameworks and libraries available for this, such as Next.js, Gatsby.js, and React SSR.

2. Configure your ASP.NET application to communicate with the Node.js server. This can be done using HTTP requests or by using a proxy server.

3. Modify your React components to handle server-side rendering. This typically involves modifying the component lifecycle methods to ensure that they render correctly on both the client and server.

4. Set up your ASP.NET application to serve the server-rendered React pages to the client. This may involve modifying your routing and middleware configuration to ensure that requests are properly handled.

Overall, server-side rendering can improve the performance and SEO of your React application, as well as provide a better experience for users with slower internet connections.

#### My thoughts: 
I was thinking that you eliminate the running an instance of your client react app. But you have to run two backend servers. A node.js one and a asp.net one.

### Question 2:
```
does that mean that you'll have two backend application running? a node.js one and your asp.net one?
```
#### Answer: 
: Yes, that's correct. To use Node.js for server-side rendering of React pages in an ASP.NET application, you would need to run both a Node.js server and an ASP.NET server simultaneously.
: The Node.js server would be responsible for rendering the React components on the server-side and generating the HTML markup for the pages. The ASP.NET server would then serve these pre-rendered pages to the client.
: However, it's worth noting that you don't necessarily need to use Node.js for server-side rendering in an ASP.NET application. There are also other server-side rendering solutions available that are written in .NET, such as ```ReactJS.NET``` or ASP.NET Core's Razor Pages. These solutions may allow you to avoid running a separate Node.js server and simplify your deployment process.

#### My thoughts: 
I'm glad i asked the question. Otherwise I might've never found out about ReactJS.NET. That's why I highlighted it. So let's explore it!
